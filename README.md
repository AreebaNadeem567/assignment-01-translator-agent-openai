# **Translator Agent Project Using Gemini API**

## **Project Overview**

**This project demonstrates an intelligent translator agent capable of converting text between Urdu and English. It leverages the Gemini API for high-quality language translation, ensuring accurate and context-aware results.**

## **Key Features**

* **Bidirectional Translation:** Converts Urdu text into English and English text into Urdu.
* **AI-Powered:** Uses Gemini API via the `agents` Python library for natural, fluent translations.
* **Asynchronous & Synchronous Support:** Can handle translations asynchronously for efficiency, or synchronously for simplicity.
* **Clean Output:** Displays translated text in a readable and well-formatted manner using the `rich` library.

## **How It Works**

**The agent is designed with a set of instructions specifying its role as a translator. When given input text, it processes the language context and outputs a translation in the target language. The Gemini API ensures the translation is natural, accurate, and context-aware.**

## **Use Cases**

* **Educational purposes:** Helps students learn and understand languages.
* **Communication:** Assists in translating messages, documents, or text content.
* **Research & Applications:** Can be integrated into apps or platforms needing automated translation services.

## **Technology Stack**

* **Python** – Main programming language
* **Gemini API** – Language model for translation
* **agents library** – Framework to build intelligent agents
* **rich** – For clean and formatted terminal output

## **Future Improvements**

* **Support for more languages** beyond Urdu and English.
* **Interactive web interface** for easier use.
* **Enhanced context retention** for long translations.
